# Digital-Twins-In-Neuro-Oncology
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a large-scale cancer dataset to support patient-specific digital twin models in neuro-oncology. The dataset used includes 50,000 records with features like Age, Gender, Country, Genetic Risk, Pollution, Lifestyle Habits (Alcohol, Smoking, Obesity), Cancer Type, Stage, Treatment Cost, and Survival Years. We conducted extensive preprocessing—removing biologically incorrect entries, encoding categorical features, and engineering new labels such as Has_Cancer—to make the dataset machine learning–ready. The cleaned data enables accurate cancer prediction and aligns with research frameworks like TumorTwin and pediatric digital twin models. This foundational work is essential for simulating personalized cancer progression and improving clinical decision-making.
